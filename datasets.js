These images enabled the generation of orthophotos, 3D meshes, and digital surface models, essential for urban planning, disaster response, and infrastructure inspection. The detailed imagery also captured vertical surfaces, such as buildings and cliffs, enhancing analysis capabilities. This project demonstrates the potential of advanced 3D data in streamlining government operations and decision-making processes.",
